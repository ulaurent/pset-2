Harvards CS50 Problem Set 2

Ceasar's Cipher:

Implemented a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher, per the below.

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to "encrypt" (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …​, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to "decrypt" them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.

The secrecy of this "cryptosystem" relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you’re perhaps the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!

Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.

Vigenere:

Implemented a program that encrypts messages using Vigenère’s cipher, per the below.

Vigenère’s cipher improves upon Caesar’s cipher by encrypting messages using a sequence of keys (or, put another way, a keyword). In other words, if p is some plaintext and k is a keyword (i.e., an alphbetical string, whereby A represents 0, B represents 1, C represents 2, …​, and Z represents 25), then each letter, ci, in the ciphertext, c, is computed as:

ci=(pi+kj)mod26
Note this cipher’s use of kj as opposed to just k. And if k is shorter than p, then the letters in k must be reused cyclically as many times as it takes to encrypt p.

In other words, if Vigenère himself wanted to say HELLO to someone confidentially, using a keyword of, say, ABC, he would encrypt the H with a key of 0 (i.e., A), the E with a key of 1 (i.e., B), and the first L with a key of 2 (i.e., C), at which point he’d be out of letters in the keyword, and so he’d reuse (part of) it to encrypt the second L with a key of 0 (i.e., A) again, and the O with a key of 1 (i.e., B) again. And so he’d write HELLO as HFNLP.

Crack:

Implemented a program that cracks passwords, per the below.

On most systems running Linux these days is a file called /etc/shadow, which contains usernames and passwords. Fortunately, the passwords therein aren’t stored "in the clear" but are instead encrypted using a "one-way hash function." When a user logs into these systems by typing a username and password, the latter is encrypted with the very same hash function, and the result is compared against the username’s entry in /etc/shadow. If the two hashes match, the user is allowed in. If you’ve ever forgotten some password, you might have been told that tech support can’t look up your password but can change it for you. Odds are that’s because tech support can only see, if anything at all, a hash of your password, not your password itself. But they can create a new hash for you.

Even though passwords in /etc/shadow are hashed, the hash function is not always that strong. Quite often are adversaries, upon obtaining that file somehow, able to guess (and check) users' passwords or crack them using brute force (i.e., trying all possible passwords). Below is what /etc/shadow might look like, albeit simplified, wherein each line is formatted as username:hash.
